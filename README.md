# 🎮 Voxel Architect

**Voxel Architect** is a real-time, gesture-controlled 3D voxel modeling web application.  
It allows users to create, edit, and manipulate 3D voxel structures using **hand gestures** captured through a webcam.

The system uses **MediaPipe Hands** for hand tracking and **Three.js** for rendering interactive 3D graphics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✋ Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- 🧱 Build 3D voxels using pinch gesture
- 🎨 Change voxel colors using hand signs
- 🌈 Disco / Rainbow lighting mode
- 🌍 Gravity burst & restore effect
- 🔄 Grab, move, rotate the entire structure
- ♻️ Reset system using dual-hand gesture
- 🖥️ Cyber-style HUD with live system state

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** (3D Rendering)
- **MediaPipe Hands** (Hand Gesture Detection)
- **WebGL**
- **Web Camera API**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The webcam captures live video input.
2. MediaPipe Hands detects hand landmarks in real time.
3. Gestures are recognized based on finger positions.
4. Recognized gestures trigger actions like:
   - Building voxels
   - Erasing voxels
   - Applying gravity
   - Changing colors
5. Three.js renders the voxel world dynamically.
